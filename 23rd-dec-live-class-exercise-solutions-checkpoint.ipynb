If  you  haven’t  guessed  it  already  the  above  statistics  are  for  text \\nmessages. The proliferation of mobile phones all over the world (it is already 100% in the USA) has led to \\nmany brands opting to include text messaging into their digital marketing strategy. Yet another statistics \\nstates that 43% of mobile advertisements prompted brand recall. These statistics confirm the fact that \\nmessages  delivered  via  mobile  text  advertising  are  more  personal  and  timelier  than  any  other \\nadvertising medium. The reach of mobile text advertising is even more owing to the ubiquity of mobile \\nphones as a constant companion in our lives. \\nAnd this is precisely our client’s business \\nplan. Developing a SaaS application on text \\nmessaging solutions that would help various \\nadvertisers  effectively  reach  their  target \\naudience  with  personal  messages  in  a \\ntimely manner was the top most priority for \\nthem.  Additionally  this  would  also  help \\nbuild a consumer database which could be \\nanalyzed further and contacted accordingly. \\nAs a software services provider they wanted \\nto  leverage  on  the  software  technologies \\nreadily  available  to  communicate  better \\nwith the target market. \\nApparently when the client contacted Mindfire, they had already been through a negative experience \\nwith the previous software vendor. However, the partnership with Mindfire proved to be a fruitful one \\nand now we are the primary software services provider for the client. They have also expressed interest \\nin Mindfire’s services when they would want to customize the platform, white label the product and \\naggressively market it to other domains. \\nAbout the Client: \\nClient: Mobile Messaging Services Provider \\nIndustry: Marketing and Advertising \\nLocation: USA \\nTechnologies Used:  \\nColdFusion10, SQL Server 2008, Bootstrap, ChartJS, BaseCamp, jUnit \\n \\ninfo@mindfiresolutions.com     www.mindfiresolutions.com  '"
